        <h1 id="h1" class="text-center ">Information on BMI</h1>
          <p>Body mass index, or BMI, is a measure of body size. It combines a person’s weight with their height. The results of a BMI measurement can give an idea about whether a person has the correct weight for their height.
            <b>BMI = kg/m2</b>. For example, an adult who weighs 70 kg and whose height is 1.75 m will have a BMI of 22.9.
             70 (kg)/1.752 (m2) = 22.9 BMI. The WHO regards an adult BMI of less than 18.5 as underweight and may indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health problems, while a BMI equal to or
             greater than 25 is considered overweight and 30 or more is considered obese. In addition to the principle, international WHO BMI cut-off points (16, 17, 18.5, 25, 30, 35 and 40), four additional cut-off points for at-risk Asians were identified (23, 27.5, 32.5 and 37.5).
             These ranges of BMI values are valid only as statistical categories.</p>
